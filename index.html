        iRobo-Lift
        </h3></li>
      <p>
        Redesigned the chassis for an iRobot Roomba to allow it to climb up stairs as part of a design challenge; side limbs were attached onto a rotating axis through the Roomba which would extend using telescopic arm mechanisms paired with linear actuators and the design was created using CAD as well as animated through dynamic simulation in Autodesk Inventor

      <p>
        Currently assembling and programming a spider robot with colleagues which when finished will not only be able to move, but also be able to track objects and detect motion through computer vision as well as have a movement stabilization feature
